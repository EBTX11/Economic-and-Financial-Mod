law_gold_standard_desc: "The Gold Standard is a monetary system in which the value of a country's currency is directly tied to a specific quantity of gold. In such a system, monetary units can be converted into a fixed amount of gold, and vice versa. The Gold Standard has historically been used to anchor currency stability and ensure confidence in the value of money. However, it has been largely abandoned in the 20th century in favor of more flexible monetary systems."

law_gold_exchange_standard_desc: "The Gold Exchange Standard was a monetary system that emerged as a variation of the Gold Standard. It operated during the interwar period, particularly after World War I and before the adoption of the Bretton Woods system. In the Gold Exchange Standard, countries held their reserves not only in gold but also in foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar, which was convertible into gold. This allowed for increased flexibility in international trade and finance, as countries could hold reserves in a mix of gold and key foreign currencies. However, the system faced challenges, including the scarcity of gold, leading to adjustments and ultimately paving the way for the Bretton Woods system in the post-World War II era."

law_floating_exchange_rates_desc: "The Floating Exchange Rates system is a monetary arrangement where the values of currencies are determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets. Unlike fixed exchange rate systems, where governments or central banks set the value of their currency in relation to another, floating exchange rates allow currency values to fluctuate freely based on market conditions"
