 caste_conflict.4.f: "The two party leaders sat across from each other, and their aides listened intently as the two minds battled for the second hour now.\n\n"Please, you must make the Justice Party see reason," [SCOPE.sCharacter('intelligentsia_leader_scope').GetFullNameNoFormatting] pleaded. "We must fight together, or we will fail!"\n\n"You will have us face the British lathis by your side, but tell me, when tomorrow comes, will you also have us govern by your side? The British have done me no more wrong than you have. Indeed, much of their deeds have been guided by your hands.""

 caste_conflict.5.t: "Untouchables and Outcasts"
 caste_conflict.5.d: "To assert their rights, the Dalit community drank from a public water tank that they had been denied access to. This nonviolent protest was led by [SCOPE.sCharacter('character_scope').GetFullName] and, in turn, met with a protest by Brahmin priests. "
 caste_conflict.5.f: "The young Dalit girl, Meena, watched the procession from afar, hidden behind a large tree. She had come here the day before with her mother, and they had drank from the water tank. It had seemed like a big event, though she had just been to skip work that day. But what she saw now horrified her, these priests were pouring cow urine and dung into the water. Had Meena drunk cow urine water? Either way, she would never drink from this polluted tank again."
 caste_conflict.5.a: "The actions of the priests are unacceptable."
 caste_conflict.5.b: "Let them keep each other distracted."
