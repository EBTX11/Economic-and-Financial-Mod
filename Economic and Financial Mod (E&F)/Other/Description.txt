[b][u]Mechanics Explaine:[/u][/b]

➩ Bank Building:
[list]
[*]The Banks are now unique building they are real central bank different for all major countries in all more than 16 different and unique central bank per country (the other countries have a generic central bank building).
[*]Every 5 years each of these banks increases by 25 Lvl up to the maximum level in order to maintain the course of the currency without inflation or deflation. But the player or the AI ​​can also increase the level of the banks as he wishes.
[*]Each of these central banks produces a unique currency (example: the Fed produces dollars, the bank of England produces sterling, the bank of France produces French francs, etc.)
[*]A total of 19 different currencies have been added: sterling/ dollar/ franc/ german mark/ real/ gulden/ yuan/ rupee/ yen/ peseta/ ottoman lira/lira/ peso/ mexican peso/ rouble/ swiss franc/ belgian franc/ florin. For example, the pop of the Ottoman Empire will ask for the Ottoman Lira, the pop of China will ask for the Yen,…
[*]All these currencies depending on the country where they circulate are used by pop as pop need and by all industries. Unlike the V1, the currency will not only have an effect on the SOL of your population according to your monetary policy but also on the entire industrial fabric.
[/list]

In production method groups you have 4 type of production method that we will detailed, in order : Minting Type, Monetary Policy, Market Operation, War Economy

First in Minting Type PM you have 3 minting type :
[list]
[*]The Gold Standard is the basic MP which allows you, thanks to Paper, Services and Gold, to create minting and currency.
[*]The no Gold Standard PM only available when your country is isolationist, because it cannot have access to the gold market, so the currencies are only created thanks to Paper, the counterpart is that your bank does not produce any minting. This forces you to open your market if you want to benefit from a larger influx of money into your Gold reserve
[*](New) Reserve Currency it’s an end-game PM, unlock with the "International Exchange Standards" tech, it’s a more modern view of things where gold standard is a past practice. It allows you to create currency and minting thanks to 4 major currencies: Sterling, Dollar, Franc, Mark. It is as if you are stockpiling foreign currency with the increased cash reserve of your banks.
[/list]
Second in Monetary Policy PM you have 3 policy type : thanks to the Gold Standard PM, it allows you to set up other PMs named monetary policy in the form of 3 other PMs:
[list]
[*]No monetary policy, this is the basic effect of the PM Gold Standard
[*]Devaluation, it is a PM that allows you to create more currency with less gold, resulting in a decrease in minting (significant), a decrease in the prestige of your country, an increase SOL of your pops. (The life of your pops becomes more simpler, they have easier access to money, so they have a better standard of living, they have more children,…)
[*]Revaluation, is the opposite more minting, less currency, decrease in the SOL of your pops, increase the prestige of your country.
[/list]
Note 1: In all these PM your bank will produce Treasury bonds
Note 2:The increase or decrease in the prestige of the country is a real fact, in real life a country which devalues its currency will be seen on the international scene as a non-responsible country or which does not know how to manage its economy correctly. These MPs are only available when the Gold Standard PM is activated.
Note 3: Contrary to the V1 these PM are now activable only by law, the more conservative Ig will want a policy of Interest Rates Increse, while the progressive/worker party will be more for a policy of Devaluation. The religious party is neutral.

Third, in Market Operation PM you have 3 Market Operation type :
[list]
[*]This PM is possible thanks to the addition of 3 Stocks: Company Stock, mine Stock, railway Stock each of these financial products are produced by default by the corresponding building.
[*]The market operations PM allowed when the PM Revaluation is activated to buy either railway Stock, or railway Stock + mine Stock, or the 3. With a decrease in the entry of gold (Which increases a lot with the PM Revaluation)
[/list]
Fourth, War Economy PM :
[list]
[*]It is a PM that can be activated thanks to a law, a law that can be voted on urgently in the Decision tab for a period of 1 year. It allows the production of War Bond by the central bank. if you have the "Mass Conscriton" law enacted, you could use these war bonds in new MP in any war-related industry: Ammunition Plans Industry Requisition/ Rifles Industry Requisition/ Artillery Industry Requisition/ Shipbuilding Industry Requisition/ War Machine Industry Requisition
[*]This PM covers all costs and replaces the goods necessary for construction. In addition you get a boost on the tariff, your country has the ability to import more goods at a lower cost, which makes it more attractive to import goods necessary for war. But the consequence of this PM is a strong penalty on the SOL of your POP.
[/list]

➩ Financial Center :
The Financial Centers are 6 unique new buildings: Bourse de Paris/ New York Stock Exchange/ Borsa di commercio di Milano/ London Stock Exchange/ Hong Kong Stock Exchange/ Borse Berlin/ Wienner Borse/ Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Note 1: They buy on the market of the country which has, the 3 types of Stocks (Company Stock, mine Stock, railway Stock) and produces a very expensive and useless good but which gives a lot of prestige: Mutual funds and produces a small quantity of Gold (It bothers me a lot because it’s not logical but it greatly facilitates the PM Gold Reserve which in V1 creates too much global demand for Gold towards the end game)
Note 2: Similar to the bank these buildings have 100 Lvl and they are all at level 25 at the start of the game with an increase of 25 Level every 25 years.
Note 3: The 3 types of Stocks are constantly in short because the demand of these financial center is global the goal is that the Mexicans stocks are exchanged in the USA or that the Spanish stocks are exchanged in London, …. In addition, the exchange of these Stocks from a country which does not have a financial center to a country which has one, makes it possible to energize a sector, indeed if the price of railway Stock is low, exporting them to different external markets will increase their price in the internal market and thus make the railways profitable.

➩ Trade Center :
[list]
[*]2 new PMs on Trade Centers linked to monetary policy.
[*]When you vote for the devaluation or revaluation of your currency, the latter loses/gains its value in relation to gold but also in relation to the other world currency, so this will have an impact on your imports and exports (More informations on discution section, Steam descriptions are too small)
