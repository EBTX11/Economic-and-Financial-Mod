sepoy_mutiny_events.1.d: "Ruling as the hereditary prime ministers of the Maratha Empire, the Bhat family were second only to the Chhatrapati in prestige and power. Now [SCOPE.sCharacter('nana_saheb_scope').GetFirstName], the adopted son of the last Peshwa comes offering his sword, promising to expel the British and restore the Empire."
sepoy_mutiny_events.1.f: "The soldier cleared his throat but it did nothing to dislodge the lump stuck in there. His forebears had been the thorn in Aurangzeb's side. A mighty force that the Chhatrapati had led to freedom against the Mughal's tyranny.\n\nBut it seemed it had all been for naught, for here they were, preparing to fight another fierce foe. Would he make his ancestors proud, or would his actions fall short? The thought fell from his mind as his captain yelled, 'FORWARD MARCH.'"
sepoy_mutiny_events.1.a: "Lead us to victory, Peshwa."
sepoy_mutiny_events.1.b: "He may serve the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], but only on the battlefield."

sepoy_mutiny_events.2.t: "The Final Blow"
sepoy_mutiny_events.2.d: "The catastrophic victory of the Indian mutineers has spurred heated debates within the offices of the Company administration. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] must now decide whether to abandon India alltogether, or to focus dwindling resources on maintaining a foothold on the continent."
sepoy_mutiny_events.2.f: "The Governor-General paced the length of his office, the walls barely containing his wrath. His aide stood perfectly still. He did not wish to land up like contents of the general's tea tray, plastered across the map of India.\n\nIndia, the golden goose they had pinned by the wings, the head, and the tail had imploded on them and all their options reeked. If it were up to him, he would take Calcutta, their first foothold, and leave the rest. Then again, Bombay had cost them dearly, and Madras had much left to offer. A tough choice -BANG!\nThe aide flinched; the general had fired his pistol into the wall. Perhaps it was time he went to see if there were more messages for the general."
sepoy_mutiny_events.2.a: "India is lost. Let Whitehall squabble over our remaining assets."
sepoy_mutiny_events.2.b: "Fort William must not fall. Redirect all forces to Calcutta."

sepoy_mutiny_events.3.t: "Mutiny!"
sepoy_mutiny_events.3.d: "The breaking point has been reached. Across India, sepoys are striking their regimental colors and taking up arms against the Company. Joined by disaffected locals of all ranks, they have seized power in cities across the continent."
sepoy_mutiny_events.3.f: "As the sepoy from Poona fires at his captain, a Muslim lad hands him more bullets. A Sikh sepoy, bleeding out from his wounds, takes in the sight. What would their forefathers say if they saw them fighting together instead of against each other? And then, as the life leaves him, a more pressing thought occers to him; what will their grandchildren say of their actions today? Waheguru, will they be proud? Ashamed? Will they even remember?"

sepoy_mutiny_events.3.tt_1: "Indian rebels will declare [concept_war] on the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
sepoy_mutiny_events.3.tt_2: "The following will be true for all [Concept('concept_presidency', '$concept_presidencies$')], based on their [Concept('concept_presidency_stability','$concept_presidency_stability_short$')]:\n• Indian rebels will take control of relevant [Concept('concept_state', '$concept_states$')]\n• Radicals and negative [Concept('concept_modifier','$concept_modifiers$')] will be added in all constituent [Concept('concept_state', '$concept_states$')]\n• A random non-capital $building_barracks$ will be destroyed"

sepoy_mutiny_events.4.t: "India in Flames"
sepoy_mutiny_events.4.d: "Sepoys in the employ of the [SCOPE.sCountry('eic_scope').GetName] have mutinied against their old masters, throwing British India into disarray. Hawkish members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] court loudly argue for us to join the rebel cause, so we may oust the British from India together."
sepoy_mutiny_events.4.f: "Few understand the burden of a crown. Even as every member of his court argues, the Prince knows they await his decision. They might call for war or wish to sue for peace, but they do so freely because they know that if it fails, they can always blame it on him. And who can he blame it on? Who will console him as he lies awake hearing the screams of soldiers who died for his promise of liberty?"
sepoy_mutiny_events.4.a: "Together we shall drive the firangi into the sea."
sepoy_mutiny_events.4.b: "Pledge our fealty to the Emperor in Delhi."

sepoy_mutiny_events.6.t: "A Matter of Taste"
sepoy_mutiny_events.6.d: "Ever since the adoption of the new, standard-issue Enfield rifle-musket, soldiers across the presidency armies have been complaining that the new gunpowder cartridges taste disgusting."
sepoy_mutiny_events.6.f: "As the Lieutenant Colonel of the 13th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, I faced a conundrum. As the regiment leader, I expected my troops to follow orders as and when I gave them. But, I had bit into the new cartridge myself and barely suppressed a gag. Would it be right to punish them when even I could not rise up to the task?"
sepoy_mutiny_events.6.a: "A soldier’s life is hard enough, research ammunition improvement."
sepoy_mutiny_events.6.b: "If they can’t stomach this, how will suffer the trials of war?"
sepoy_mutiny_cartridge_grease_exploration: "Cartridge Grease Experiments"

sepoy_mutiny_events.7.t: "A Tasteful Solution"
sepoy_mutiny_events.7.d: "Beeswax has been suggested as an alternative to the grease used on the cartridges. The troops are happy with this change. However, some are asking what changed."
sepoy_mutiny_events.7.f: "The soldiers sat around the canteen that night, pleased that the company had provided them with better cartridges.\n\n"So, if these new cartridges use beeswax" asked a sepoy, chewing his roti, "then what did the old ones use?"\n\n"What does it matter" replied a young sepoy, "so long as they don’t smell like your mother, I’ll bite into them.""
sepoy_mutiny_events.7.a: "Explain to the troops that beeswax replaced a factory-made grease."

sepoy_mutiny_events.8.t: "First Signs of Trouble"
sepoy_mutiny_events.8.d: "Soldiers in the Bengal Presidency have heard rumors that the grease used on the cartridges is animal fat."
sepoy_mutiny_events.8.f: "The young subedar had not slept all night. He threw up again, panic twisting his gut, 'What if the rumors were true? Had he really bit into cow fat?'' He looked at the temple across the road, 'Would he still be welcome there? What about home? What would happen to his wife? Their son? Or perhaps there was no cause for worry, the Captain had assured them it was just a chemical. The Captain wouldn’t lie to them!'"
sepoy_mutiny_events.8.a: "Reassure the soldiers it is not animal fat."
sepoy_mutiny_events.8.b: "Suggest soldiers use their hands to open the cartridges if the taste offends them."
sepoy_mutiny_timer_decrease_5_months: "Advance the timer for the $je_uneasy_raj$ [concept_journal_entry] by #variable 5#! months."
sepoy_mutiny_alternative_cartridge_handling: "Alternative Cartridge Handling"
sepoy_mutiny_alternative_cartridge_debacle: "Caved to Sepoy Demands"

sepoy_mutiny_events.9.t: "An Unavoidable Mess"
sepoy_mutiny_events.9.d: "The rumors have taken root and some soldiers believe the cartridges were, or are, an attempt at forced conversion. They are refusing to fire weapons during drills."
sepoy_mutiny_events.9.f: "The Captain was worried, he was sure he had seen some off-duty soldiers following him as he exited the church. A tense air hung over the camp, the native regiments had been acting odd, breaking curfew, sticking together in large groups, carrying their rifles off-duty, and apparently some had refused to follow orders.\n\nHe counted the other British officers in the camp, a fair number, could they hold their own if the natives rebelled? A nervous laugh escaped his mouth. No, if it came to that they would be dead before their first reload."
sepoy_mutiny_events.9.a: "Punish soldiers with hard labor."
sepoy_mutiny_events.9.b: "Relieve them of their duty but let the rest continue"

sepoy_mutiny_events.10.t: "The First Domino Falls"
sepoy_mutiny_events.10.d: "On hearing that troops have been sentenced to hard labor, sepoys from other regiments have broken rank and attempted to break their fellow soldiers free."
sepoy_mutiny_events.10.f: "Cawnpore Garrison.\nTo General [SCOPE.sCharacter('sepoy_general_scope').GetLastNameNoFormatting]\n\nUrgent.\n\nSome 50 sepoys have barred themselves in the ammunition hold and are firing at any officers that approach. Trouble began at midnight when they got drunk and attacked their superior officer. Remaining regiments have been disarmed and asked to stay in their barracks. The loyal among them have advised that the mutineers intend to free the troops sentenced to hard labor.\n\nPlease Advice!"
sepoy_mutiny_events.10.a: "Punish all who participate."
sepoy_mutiny_events.10.b: "Punish all troops."
